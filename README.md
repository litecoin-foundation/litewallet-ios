## Easy and secure
Litewallet is the best way to get started with Litecoin. Our simple, streamlined design is easy for beginners, yet powerful enough for experienced users. This is a free app produced by the Litecoin Foundation.

## Donations
The Litewallet Team is a group of global volunteers & part of the Litecoin Foundation that work hard to promote the use of Litecoin. Litewallet takes alot of time and resources to improve and test features but we need your help.  Please consider donating to one of our addresses:

## Completely decentralized

Unlike other iOS Litecoin wallets, **Litewallet** is a standalone Litecoin client. It connects directly to the Litecoin network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if Litewallet is removed from the App Store, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their valuable Litecoin at any time.

## Cutting-edge security

**Litewallet** utilizes AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and the latest iOS security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. Private keys are stored only in the secure enclave of the user's phone, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.

### Designed with new users in mind

Simplicity and ease-of-use is **Litewallet**'s core design principle. A simple recovery phrase (which we call a paper key) is all that is needed to restore the user's wallet if they ever lose or replace their device. **Litewallet** is [deterministic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), which means the user's balance and transaction history can be recovered just from the paper key.

## Features:

- ["simplified payment verification"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0037.mediawiki) for fast mobile performance
- no server to get hacked or go down
- single backup phrase that works forever
- private keys never leave your device
- import [password protected](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) paper wallets
- ["payment protocol"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0070.mediawiki) payee identity certification

### Building & Developing Litewallet for iOS:
***Installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged.***

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data. This means it can access your wallet and steal your Litecoin by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8) and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its .entitlements file.

1. Download and install Cocoapods to your Mac computer: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
3. Clone this repo & init submodules
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/litecoin-foundation/loafwallet-ios
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
4. From the root where the Podfile is located, install the pods: `pod install`
5. From the root where the *Xcode Workspace* is located, open the project: `open loafwallet.xcworkspace`
